Published at FAccT 2023.

The repository is organized as follows:
- The code for running our Mechanical Turk experiment can be found in `AMT`.
- The trivia questions themselves and the raw results from both our pilot study and main experiment can be found in `raw_data`.
- Raw data is processed in `data_processing.py`, output (i.e., clean data, several formats) can be found in `processed_data`
- Data visualizations are generated in `raw_data_visualization.ipynb`
- Scripts for running the IRT models can be found in `modeling`. Output of these scripts is in the `modeling_results` folder.
- Processing of these results is in `modeling_results.ipynb`.
