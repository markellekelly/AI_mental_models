    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      In this experiment, you will answer 16 sets of trivia questions.
      Each set contains 12 questions related to a particular trivia topic. </p>
    <p>
      After answering all 12 questions in a set, you will be asked to estimate the number of questions you answered correctly (between 0 and 12).

      In addition to estimating your own performance, you will also estimate the performance of another participant, <b><span id="hName"></span></b>.

    <p id="otherExp2">
      In addition to estimating your own performance, you will also estimate the performance of an <b>artificial intelligence (AI) system</b>, which
        is a technology that has analyzed large amounts of data and can use this information to answer new questions. 
    </p>
    <p>
      <b>Bonuses of up to $2</b> will be awarded based on your assessment of <span id="whoWho"></span>'s performance. Estimates that are closer to
