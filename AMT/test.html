    <h3>Instructions</h3>
    <p>
      In this experiment, you will answer 16 sets of trivia questions.
      Each set contains 12 questions related to a particular trivia topic. </p>
    <p>
      After answering all 12 questions in a set, you will be asked to estimate the number of questions you answered correctly (between 0 and 12).
